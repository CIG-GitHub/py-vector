# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing.

This project is still evolving, and the API may change. Contributions are welcome, but please open an issue or discussion before starting large changes.

## Guidelines

- Keep changes focused and well-scoped.
- Follow existing code style and conventions.
- Include tests where appropriate.
- Be clear about the motivation for a change.

## Issues

If you believe something is broken, please include:
- a minimal reproducible example
- expected vs actual behavior
- relevant environment details

If the issue is about design or semantics, please explain the use case rather than arguing from precedent. Different design tradeoffs are expected; productive discussion focuses on concrete use cases and observed behavior.

## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to follow the project's Code of Conduct.
